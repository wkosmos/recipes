# Sauerkraut

## Ingredients

- cabbage
- salt - 3% weight of cabbage (ideally pickling salt but it's probably not the end of the world)
- water

## Method

1. slice cabbage into strips
2. mix salt with cabbage and let sit for a few hours until a bunch of water has come out
3. pack the cabbage down into jars and top up with water until fully submerged
4. put lids on jars loosely so air can escape and wait 
5. should be good starting at like 4 days, can go for up to 4-6 weeks
6. put it in the fridge when it's as done as you want it
